Intentionally luring readers to click on a certain content by exploiting their curiosity defines a title as clickbait. Although several studies focused to detect clickbaits in English articles, low resource language like Bangla has not been given adequate attention. To tackle clickbait titles in Bangla, we created an annotated dataset of $\approx15 K$ news articles and $\approx65 K$ unannotated news articles which can be used to create supervised or semi-supervised classification models. For the supervised approach, we ran a detailed comparison among traditional linguistic feature based models, deep neural networks and state of the art Transformer models. We also investigated whether training the Transformer models in semi-supervised learning approach with the unannotated dataset can help improve the performance of the system. Extensive experiments on these two approaches show that semi-supervised approach does not provide significant performance gain than its supervised counterparts. We expect that this dataset and the detailed analysis and comparison of these clickbait detection systems will provide a fundamental basis for future research into detecting clickbaits in Bengali articles.
